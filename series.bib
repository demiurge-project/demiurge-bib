@comment{This file contains string definitions for the series field.}
@comment{It is sorted alphabetically by the string definition of the series name, including every letter. Space goes before other letters.}

@comment{The key should be INITIALS, where INITIALS are representative initials of the conference proceedings.}
@comment{Only include characters A-Z and a-z for the key. Drop or replace other characters as appropriate.}
@comment{The proceedings names should be written in UTF-8. Do not escape special characters.}
@comment{Here are some characters that might be useful, so you can copy and paste them:}
@comment{é ß ó ñ á ü Á ë ú ó Ş ö ä ã ç č ø ł è ô}

@comment{There is a known issue, if the Publisher name starts with a non-ASCII character, the compilation for certain bibliography styles can break}
@comment{Only in this case, escape the first letter of the first name like shown here: https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/57745}
@comment{As an alternative you can use pybtex, a library claiming to be fully compatible with Bibtex and UTF-8}
